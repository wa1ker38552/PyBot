# PyBot

PyBot is a Discord bot that compilies code in Python!

**Features:**
- Error catching: PyBot will check a script for errors and return the error as if on a normal IDE/Compiler
- Imports: PyBot can install most imports (Any of which are pre-installed from Replit!)

PyBot cannot run while loops or any script that requests user input. Any script that runs in a loop will execute and the output would be printed out instead of being printed while it's executing.

PyBot can be hosted using Replit by using the ```keepAlive()``` function. If you plan to host it using your own computer, remove the ```keepAlive()``` function.

**Usage:**
To write code on Discord use:
compile:
```
whatever code here
```

Make sure to add 3 tick marks so the bot recongnizes it as code! (```)
